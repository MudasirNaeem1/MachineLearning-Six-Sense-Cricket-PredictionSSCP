🚀Interesting Project for Cricket 🏏 Lovers 😉
🙂SIX SENSE T20I CRICKET PREDICTION SYSTEM!
 
I developed this predictive model using Python, leveraging libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Tkinter, Customtkinter, Scikit-learn, and Pipeline. The system aims to predict the winner of the upcoming T20 World Cup matches based on venue and toss results. 

Key Features:
- 👀User Interface: Built with Customtkinter, allowing users to select Team#1, Team#2, match venue, and toss winner.
- 📊Data Analysis: Utilized Pandas library for data manipulation and Matplotlib for data visualization.
- 🖥️Machine Learning: Implemented Scikit-learn library for creating the predictive model.
- ✅Prediction Accuracy: Achieved an impressive accuracy of 96%, making predictions highly reliable.

How It Works:
1. 🇵🇰Select Teams🇮🇪 and Venue: Users input Team 1, Team 2, and the venue where the match will be held.
2. Toss Update: Users update which team won the toss.
3. 🏆Prediction: The system predicts the winning team based on historical data and venue-specific performance
